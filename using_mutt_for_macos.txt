make MUTT more friendly:

GOOBOOK:

  pip install goobook --ignore-installed six
  (may have to use sudo)
  goobook authenticate
  (will open up a browser window)
  goobook reload
  chmod   600 .goobook*
  add these lines to .muttrc:

    set query_command="goobook query %s"
    set editor = "vim --cmd 'let g:goobookrc=\"/Users/jp/.goobookrc\"'"
    bind editor <Tab> complete-query


MUTT COMMANDS:

Mutt uses a lot of single letter commands. Here are the most common.

m - create a new message
d - delete a message
u - undelete a message
r - reply to a message
$ - update server (when you delete messages, they aren't deleted until you do an update, with $)
q - quit

if you have goobook installed, when you are choosing the "To" email, you can type part of a name, then hit tab, and a list of matching options will pop up
