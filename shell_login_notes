# User-specific settings for all shells

# There are 3 different types of shells in bash: the login shell, normal shell
# and interactive shell. Login shells read ~/.profile and interactive shells
# read ~/.bashrc; in our setup, /etc/profile sources ~/.bashrc - thus all
# settings made here will also take effect in a login shell.

# Generally, environment variables should be set in the profile files. They
# will be set once in the first shell you open (the login shell), and any
# shells spawned from it  will inherit the login shell's environment variables.
# Aliases, which do not carry over like environment variables,  should be set
# in rc files, so that they are recreated every time a shell starts.
